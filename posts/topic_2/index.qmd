### SLR investigating the impact of human interactions between software developers and users

**Abstract**

The end user experience of software can often be unpredictable, even with focus group sessions and extensive testing. The interactions between software developers and end users plays an important role in the outcome of the product, with particular importance in the areas of requirements gathering and usability satisfaction. This research will focus on identifying forms of interaction, and measuring their effectiveness, as well as challenges and barriers to meaningful collaboration.

## Research Questions

- **RQ1**: What forms of interaction between software developers and users are commonly studied in the literature?
- **RQ2**: How do these interactions affect the quality and success of software systems?
- **RQ3**: What challenges or barriers exist in facilitating effective developer-user interactions?
- **RQ4**: identifying forms of interaction
- **RQ5**: How do different development contexts (e.g., agile vs. traditional, open source vs. enterprise) influence the nature of developer-user interactions?

**Requirements**
